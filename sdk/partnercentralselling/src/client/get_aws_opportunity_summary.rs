Accepted values include <code>AWS</code> for production opportunities or <code>Sandbox</code> for testing purposes. The catalog determines which environment the opportunity data is pulled from.</p><br>
    ///   - [`related_opportunity_identifier(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::get_aws_opportunity_summary::builders::GetAwsOpportunitySummaryFluentBuilder::related_opportunity_identifier) / [`set_related_opportunity_identifier(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::get_aws_opportunity_summary::builders::GetAwsOpportunitySummaryFluentBuilder::set_related_opportunity_identifier):<br>required: **true**<br><p>The unique identifier for the related partner opportunity.

    ///   - [`catalog(String)`](crate::operation::get_aws_opportunity_summary::GetAwsOpportunitySummaryOutput::catalog): <p>Specifies the catalog in which the AWS Opportunity exists. This is the environment (e.g., <code>AWS</code> or <code>Sandbox</code>) where the opportunity is being managed.</p>
    ///   - [`related_opportunity_id(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::get_aws_opportunity_summary::GetAwsOpportunitySummaryOutput::related_opportunity_id): <p>Provides the unique identifier of the related partner opportunity, allowing partners to link the AWS Opportunity to their corresponding opportunity in their CRM system.</p>
    ///   - [`origin(Option<OpportunityOrigin>)`](crate::operation::get_aws_opportunity_summary::GetAwsOpportunitySummaryOutput::origin): <p>Specifies whether the AWS Opportunity originated from AWS or the partner. This helps distinguish between opportunities that were sourced by AWS and those referred by the partner.</p>
    ///   - [`involvement_type(Option<SalesInvolvementType>)`](crate::operation::get_aws_opportunity_summary::GetAwsOpportunitySummaryOutput::involvement_type): <p>Specifies the type of involvement AWS has in the opportunity, such as direct co-sell or advisory support. This field helps partners understand the role AWS will play in advancing the opportunity.</p>
    ///   - [`visibility(Option<Visibility>)`](crate::operation::get_aws_opportunity_summary::GetAwsOpportunitySummaryOutput::visibility): <p>Defines the visibility level for the AWS Opportunity. Use <code>Full</code> visibility for most cases, while <code>Limited</code> visibility is reserved for special programs or sensitive opportunities.</p>
    ///   - [`life_cycle(Option<AwsOpportunityLifeCycle>)`](crate::operation::get_aws_opportunity_summary::GetAwsOpportunitySummaryOutput::life_cycle): <p>Contains lifecycle information for the AWS Opportunity, including review status, stage, and target close date. This field is crucial for partners to monitor the progression of the opportunity.</p>
    ///   - [`opportunity_team(Option<Vec::<AwsTeamMember>>)`](crate::operation::get_aws_opportunity_summary::GetAwsOpportunitySummaryOutput::opportunity_team): <p>Details the AWS Opportunity team, including key members involved in the opportunity. This information helps partners know who from AWS is engaged and their roles in the opportunity.</p>
    ///   - [`insights(Option<AwsOpportunityInsights>)`](crate::operation::get_aws_opportunity_summary::GetAwsOpportunitySummaryOutput::insights): <p>Provides insights into the AWS Opportunity, including engagement score and recommended actions that AWS suggests for the partner.</p>
    ///   - [`involvement_type_change_reason(Option<InvolvementTypeChangeReason>)`](crate::operation::get_aws_opportunity_summary::GetAwsOpportunitySummaryOutput::involvement_type_change_reason): <p>Provides a reason for any changes in the involvement type of AWS in the opportunity. This field is used to track why the level of AWS engagement has changed from <code>For Visibility Only</code> to <code>Co-sell</code> offering transparency into the partnership dynamics.</p>
    ///   - [`related_entity_ids(Option<AwsOpportunityRelatedEntities>)`](crate::operation::get_aws_opportunity_summary::GetAwsOpportunitySummaryOutput::related_entity_ids): <p>Lists related entity identifiers, such as AWS products or partner solutions, associated with the AWS Opportunity. These identifiers provide additional context and help partners understand which AWS services are involved.</p>
    ///   - [`customer(Option<AwsOpportunityCustomer>)`](crate::operation::get_aws_opportunity_summary::GetAwsOpportunitySummaryOutput::customer): <p>Provides details about the customer associated with the AWS Opportunity, including account information, industry, and other key customer data.
