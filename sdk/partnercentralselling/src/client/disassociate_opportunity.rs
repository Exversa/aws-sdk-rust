This field takes a string value from a predefined list: <code>AWS</code> or <code>Sandbox</code>. The catalog determines which environment the opportunity disassociation is made in. Use <code>AWS</code> to disassociate opportunities in the Amazon Web Services catalog, and <code>Sandbox</code> for testing in secure, isolated environments.</p><br>

This identifier helps to ensure that the correct opportunity is updated.</p> <p>Validation: Ensure that the provided identifier corresponds to an existing opportunity in the Amazon Web Services system because incorrect identifiers result in an error and no changes are made.</p><br>
