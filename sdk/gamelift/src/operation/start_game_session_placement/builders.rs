/// <p>Makes a request to start a new game session using a game session queue. When processing a placement request in a queue, Amazon GameLift finds the best possible available resource to host the game session and prompts the resource to start the game session.</p>
/// <p><b>Request options</b></p>
/// <p>Call this API with the following minimum parameters: <i>GameSessionQueueName</i>, <i>MaximumPlayerSessionCount</i>, and <i>PlacementID</i>. You can also include game session data (data formatted as strings) or game properties (data formatted as key-value pairs) to pass to the new game session.</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p>You can change how Amazon GameLift chooses a hosting resource for the new game session. Prioritizing resources for game session placements is defined when you configure a game session queue. You can use the default prioritization process or specify a custom process by providing a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_PriorityConfiguration.html"> PriorityConfiguration</a> when you create or update a queue.</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p>Prioritize based on resource cost and location, using the queue's configured priority settings. Call this API with the minimum parameters.</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p>Prioritize based on latency. Include a set of values for <i>PlayerLatencies</i>. You can provide latency data with or without player session data. This option instructs Amazon GameLift to reorder the queue's prioritized locations list based on the latency data. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each location's average latency for all players and reorders to find the lowest latency across all players. Don't include latency data if you're providing a custom list of locations.</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p>Prioritize based on a custom list of locations. If you're using a queue that's configured to prioritize location first (see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_PriorityConfiguration.html">PriorityConfiguration</a> for game session queues), use the <i>PriorityConfigurationOverride</i> parameter to substitute a different location list for this placement request. When prioritizing placements by location, Amazon GameLift searches each location in prioritized order to find an available hosting resource for the new game session. You can choose whether to use the override list for the first placement attempt only or for all attempts.</p></li>
/// </ul></li>
/// <li>
/// <p>You can request new player sessions for a group of players. Include the <i>DesiredPlayerSessions</i> parameter and include at minimum a unique player ID for each. You can also include player-specific data to pass to the new game session.</p></li>
/// </ul>
/// <p><b>Result</b></p>
/// <p>If successful, this request generates a new game session placement request and adds it to the game session queue for Amazon GameLift to process in turn. You can track the status of individual placement requests by calling <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeGameSessionPlacement.html">DescribeGameSessionPlacement</a>. A new game session is running if the status is <code>FULFILLED</code> and the request returns the game session connection information (IP address and port). If you include player session data, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each player ID in the request.</p>
/// <p>The request results in a <code>BadRequestException</code> in the following situations:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p>If the request includes both <i>PlayerLatencies</i> and <i>PriorityConfigurationOverride</i> parameters.</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p>If the request includes the <i>PriorityConfigurationOverride</i> parameter and designates a queue doesn't prioritize locations.</p></li>
/// </ul>
/// <p>Amazon GameLift continues to retry each placement request until it reaches the queue's timeout setting. If a request times out, you can resubmit the request to the same queue or try a different queue.</p>
